-           Finding out what makes the World what it is & where my contributions are with my place in the whole "Circle of Life Matrix" design Network dynamics. I Have SOOOO many questions about us & our natural instinctive design. There are just so many things that I have been awakened in 3rd eye sight to that DO NOT MAKE AN OUNCE OF FRIGGIN SENSE AT ALL! WE are the most confusing creatures. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
-           How to struggle through & own the real reality truth of universal facts outside of majority assumed options & beliefs. The consequences of ignorance, as blissful as they claim it to be, are truly one of the hardest things to carry the weight of consequences, long term, on. It is not easy to come up against the main stream of the social acceptances of the majority & endure the inner spiritual progress of individuality. As much as we claim to appreciate the individuality of each other, we truly have a lot of "expected" acceptances of beliefs & ideas toward the main streams thinking & understandings.
